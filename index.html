    <div>Hi Everyone! My name is Fizzo [feet:so}. I was born in Vienna, Austria and moved here when I was 25. I love
      gardening, cooking, building things, spending time in nature and computers..... I have had a photography business
      for 8 years (dogs and horses). I have been a manager for a small nutritional supplement company (colloidal silver
      water). I was a banquet server for the last 6 years.
      I love people but I started yearning for more. Especially using more of my mind and my creativity. Like many of
      you I remembered fiddling with programming (basic) way back when. I just finished 102 and I have absolutely fallen
      in love with what I am learning. I feel like a kid at Christmas. I am looking forward to learning more and growing
      and having more amazing experiences with you all. I love seeing so many different styles, ways of expressing the
      same assignment. Thank you all for giving your best.</div>
